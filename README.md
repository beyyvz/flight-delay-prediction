## Flight Delay Prediction Using Machine Learning

Course: CAP 4630 – Intro to Artificial Intelligence

## Project Overview:

Flight delays affect millions of passengers and cost airlines billions of dollars annually.
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a flight will be delayed or on time using historical flight data from the 2015 U.S. DOT dataset.

## Objectives:
- Predict flight delays using machine learning models
- Classify flights as: Delayed (≥ 15 minutes) or On Time
- Compare model performance using standard evaluation metrics
- Analyze which features most influence delays

## Dataset
Source: U.S. DOT On-Time Performance Dataset (2015)

Size: ~5.8 million flight records

Type: Structured tabular data

Features include:
- Airline
- Origin airport
- Destination airport
- Departure time
- Flight distance
- Arrival delay (target variable)

## Methodology:

1. Data Preprocessing
- Removed rows with missing critical values
- Created binary target variable: Delay ≥ 15 min → 1, On-time → 0

One-hot encoded categorical features:
- Airline
- Origin airport
- Destination airport
  

2. Feature Engineering
- Used numerical features such as departure time and distance
- Handled class imbalance in dataset
- Sampled 200,000 rows for efficient training


3. Model Training
- Decision Tree Classifier (scikit-learn)
- Train/Test split: 80/20
- Pipeline used for preprocessing + model training


4. Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix


## Results:
- Accuracy: 83.8% (can be anything, since its adjusted based on flight time/miles/airline
- Model performs well at predicting on-time flights
- Slight difficulty detecting delayed flights due to class imbalance

## Key Insights:
- Departure time is the most important feature in predicting delays
- Origin and destination airports also have strong influence
- Airline has relatively low impact compared to timing and route

## Visualizations:
- Confusion matrix shows strong performance on majority class (on-time flights)

Feature importance highlights:
- Departure time (highest impact)
- Airport features (moderate impact)
- Distance (lower impact)

## Challenges:
- Large dataset (~5.8M rows) required sampling for performance
- Class imbalance between delayed vs on-time flights
- Feature encoding increased dimensionality significantly

## Future Improvements:
- Try more advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Use techniques for class imbalance (SMOTE or class weighting)
- Add external features such as:
- Weather conditions
- Seasonal trends
- Hyperparameter tuning for better performance
